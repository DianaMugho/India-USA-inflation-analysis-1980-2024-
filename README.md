# Comparative Analysis of India-USA Inflation and Exchange Rate Trends

## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between inflation rates in India and the United States and the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee (INR) and the US Dollar (USD) from 1980 to 2024. Using historical data, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and possible factors influencing exchange rate fluctuations over time.

## Key Findings
Early 2000s: A period of high inflation in India coincided with stability in the INR-USD exchange rate, indicating that factors beyond inflation, such as government policies or trade balances, may have been at play.

Late 2000s to Early 2010s: As inflation rose in India, the INR began to weaken, suggesting that inflation may have influenced currency depreciation, aligning with traditional economic theories.

2015 Onwards: Despite relatively low inflation in both countries, the INR continued to depreciate against the USD. This suggests that factors such as economic growth rates, monetary policies, and global trade dynamics are likely influencing the exchange rate.

## Data Sources
Exchange Rate Data: Collected from reputable financial sources, covering monthly INR-USD exchange rates.
Inflation Rates: Historical inflation data for India and the USA, allowing for comparative analysis over several decades.
## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual and statistical analysis to identify trends, outliers, and patterns.
Comparative Analysis: Assessing the relationship between inflation rates and exchange rate movements across different periods.
Factor Analysis: Exploring other potential contributors, such as GDP growth and policy shifts, that might impact the exchange rate.
## Tools Used
power-BI for visualization
Python: For data analysis and visualization (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and visualization.
## Conclusion
This analysis highlights the complexity of exchange rate dynamics, demonstrating that while inflation is a contributing factor, other macroeconomic variables also play a significant role in determining the INR-USD exchange rate over time.

## Future Work
Further studies could include:

Expanding the dataset to incorporate additional economic factors.
Exploring more sophisticated econometric models to quantify the impact of each factor on the exchange rate.
Extending the analysis to other emerging market currencies for a broader perspective.
